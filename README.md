While I don't plan to be competative I do plan to use it as a chance to expose myself to new challenges and stretch my coding skills into new scenarios that will ideally lead me to learning new tools and techniques.
I will be completing everyday's first task everyday until completing the calendar to maintain pace with a friend. I will be posting the days however AFTER completing the second task of the days. If you see holes, they tasks are on the way!
Overtime I will realistically come back and potentially poke at some of these after due to feedback I am recieving from friends in the field as well as using some of these prompts to explore some newer libraries with functionality I have 
no doubt will make some of these problems much easier (looking at you numpy).
